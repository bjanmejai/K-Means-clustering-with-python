K-means clustering is very effective when segmenting data and attempting to find patterns. Because
clustering is used in a broad array of industries, becoming proficient in this process will help you
expand your skillset in a widely applicable way.
In this activity, you are a consultant for a scientific organization that works to support and sustain
penguin colonies. You are tasked with helping other staff members learn more about penguins in
order to achieve this mission.
The data for this activity is in a spreadsheet that includes datapoints across a sample size of 345
penguins, such as species, island, and sex. Your will use a K-means clustering model to group this
data and identify patterns that provide important insights about penguins.
